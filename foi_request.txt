FAO The Library Service.

Dear Library Service, 

Hello.  I have two requests that shouldn't be much trouble.

1. Could you answer if the library service or local authority completes annual CIPFA library stats.  These are as detailed here:
http://www.cipfa.org/services/statistics/comparative-profiles/public-libraries

2. If the answer to the above is Yes, please could you send your 2017 CIPFA library stats return (covering financial year 2016/2017)?

It is important that this should be sent in the exact format (a copy of the same file) that is sent to CIPFA.  If it has not yet been sent to CIPFA I'd be happy for you to simply send a copy to complete this Freedom of Information request when you send the data to CIPFA.

To try and pre-empt any concerns about this request, there is no reason why the authority should not be able to also supply this data to third parties as well as CIPFA. And in this case it's subject to Freedom of Information, without exemption, as it is data that is compiled and held by the authority.

There are many examples of previous Freedom of Information requests for this data.  Only one seemed to be rejected, by Derbyshire County Council, based on their belief that it was exempt as it would be possible to obtain these from CIPFA.  This was clearly wrong though, and was overturned on appeal by the Solicitor for the Director of Legal Services in that Council.

If you're interested (though it's not very interesting) you can read it through here:

But anyway, it'll be a good thing so don't worry!

Yours faithfully

Dave
